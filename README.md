# Movie API

Welcome to the Movie API project! This backend API helps manage and interact with movie data for a movie-based website. It provides features to sort, search, filter, and paginate through a collection of movies.

## Features

- **Sorting**: Organize the list of movies based on different criteria, such as rating or year. You can choose to sort in ascending or descending order.

- **Searching**: Find movies by their name using a keyword. This feature allows you to search for movies that contain the keyword anywhere in their title.

- **Filtering**: Narrow down the list of movies based on their genre. You can filter by specific genres like Action, Romance, or Comedy, or select multiple genres at once.

- **Pagination**: Break down the list of movies into smaller chunks or pages. This helps in managing large datasets by allowing you to view a limited number of movies per page and navigate through them.

- **Flexible Querying**: Customize the API requests with various query parameters to get exactly the data you need. For example, you can specify the number of results per page and which page to display.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: A web framework for Node.js that simplifies building web APIs.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving movie data.
- **CORS**: Middleware for handling cross-origin requests, allowing the API to be accessed from different origins.

This API is designed to help you efficiently manage movie data and provide a smooth experience for users exploring movies on your website.
